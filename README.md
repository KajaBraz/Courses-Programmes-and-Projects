# Courses-Programmes-and-Projects
At the time being, the repository contains the following:
- Analog Clock: a clock face with moving hands developed in JavaScript;
- Books Similarity: given some text files (ex. books), the programme calculates the texts' similarities and shows the similarity scores of each text pair in a dataframe. A book title can be passed to a function and the programme will create a chart with the similarity scores of all other books given. Here, we take as an example Charles Darwin's books;
- Data Structures: the implementation of tree, graph, heap, hash map, linked list, which have been used in the Wilderness Escape Adventure Game and Blossom - Flowers Definitions;
- Random Walker: random movements simulation in which the object starts the walk at position (0, 0) and moves in random directions a given number of steps; the steps follow the standard normal distribution; the X-displacement and Y-displacement of a each step are independent from each other (horizontal and vertical displacements are not influenced); 10, 100, 500, 1000, and 10000 steps represenations of random walks are provided.
