# Courses-Programmes-and-Projects
At the time being, the repository contains the following:
- Books Similarity: given some text files (ex. books), the programme calculates the texts' similarities and shows the similarity scores of each text pair in a dataframe. Here, we take as an example Charles Darwin's books;
- Data Structures: the implementation of tree, graph, heap, hash map, linked list, which have been used in the Wilderness Escape Adventure Game and Blossom - Flowers Definitions.
